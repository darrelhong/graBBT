# Notes

## Darrel
- Can't figure out how to selectively process only certain form fields (for create new lisiting)

- Super dodgy image upload for listing
	- the ui is weird cos gotta click upload separately, couldn't figure out how to upload together with submit button
	-  files get uploaded to `C:/NetBeansProjects/proj/graBBT/graBBT-war/web/resources/image` so that it can be accessed through web resources (def not the right way, prolly need to consult on the best way to do it)
	- so either move your project folder accordingly OR adjust your `alternatedocroot_1` variable in `web.xml`
- Still figuring out categories

## Chloe
- Create new outlet to allow panel/list view
- Logout confirmation dialogue still fixing
- Retailer "my account page" 
	- Include Profile details & simple overview details of outlets, listings and revenue 
	- Each detail should be able to be clicked on --> redirect to the relevant page with their full details
- Want to build a retailer Notifications tab (when order comes in, when payment completes)
